# The Good Template #

Version 0.4

The basis of everything I do.

## Who the what now? ##

**The Good Template** is an attempt to create the perfect
basis for future web design projects (for me). Here's why it's great:

- Text baseline (I have yet to see a perfect implementation of this in a mainstream template)
- Responsive grid system (Á la [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton))
- Awesome default styles (Á la [Bootrap.css](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/))

## Why, exactly? ##

A lot of great templates, like 
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) have
too much cruft for me. I don't want to include twenty
files!

Most templates do not have a "good" text baseline. This
works the way I want it.

## Wow, that's cool! ##

Not really. I have used so much as inspiration and tried to
credit it when I can, but just in case: 
[HTML5Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate),
[Baseline.css](http://baselinecss.com/),
[Bootstrap.css](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/),
[Frameless Grids](https://github.com/jonikorpi/Frameless/blob/master/frameless.less), and
[Skeleton](https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton).

Besides, since I plan on using this as the basis for *all*
my design projects, I hope it's as good as possible.

## How to ##

Everything is set up for you: `.less` files, basic `.html` 
files, everything. Just fork it or download it and get to
work.
